	{"character_name": "Piper", "dialogue": "... It was just me. For a long time, I've always wanted... to make you happy. You’re my only friend in the world. My bestest friend. No matter what, I want to see you smile forever."},

	{"character_name": "A5", "dialogue": "Then, I'll say it right now. I've always wanted to tell you that I care about you, [color=#b38b2b]Piper[/color]. Even when I forget your name, I'll always remember how much I love you."},

	{"character_name": "Piper", "dialogue": "But you’re mad at me."},
	{"character_name": "A5", "dialogue": "Not forever. Not you, [color=#b38b2b]Piper[/color]. My job as your best friend is to help you fix your mistakes. So, come on. Let’s make our own ending."},
